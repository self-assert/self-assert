## Credits and Acknowledgements

This project is based on the ideas presented by Hern치n Wilkinson ([@hernanwilkinson][hernan-url])
in his [Dise침o a la Gorra][disenio-a-la-gorra] webinar.

Dise침o a la Gorra is a webinar exploring the principles of object-oriented software design,
with a focus on practical examples and heuristics for creating high-quality software.
The videos are primarily in Spanish; however, the code is self-explanatory.

A core idea of Dise침o a la Gorra is understanding software as a **model of a real-world problem**.
Developing software, therefore, is fundamentally the act of **designing an effective model**.

According to this perspective:

- A good software model **abstracts the relevant aspects** of the problem domain,
  allowing for clear understanding and effective solutions.
- Software design is a continuous process of **learning and refining** the model.
- A good model not only works but also **teaches** how to interact with it through its structure and behavior.
- **Objects** within the software should represent **entities of the domain** and be created
  **complete** and **valid** from the outset, reflecting a coherent state of the real world.

The concepts behind `self-assert` were introduced in [Episode 2][dalg-t1-ch2] ("Valid Objects")
and further refined in [Episode 3][dalg-t1-ch3] ("Modeling Sets of Objects").
