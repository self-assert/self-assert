**Inspired by [Hern√°n Wilkinson][hernan-url]‚Äôs
‚Äú[Dise√±o a la Gorra][disenio-a-la-gorra]‚Äù webinar**‚Äîsoftware
as a model of real‚Äëworld problems, continuous refinement of that model,
and objects that encapsulate and protect their own validity.

## Introduction

`self-assert` is a small TypeScript library that
helps you model domain rules _inside_ your objects
‚Äî not as external validators, but as collaborators in their own creation.

This library encourages a mindset where rules are expressed in
terms of the domain, and
**objects are created complete, valid, and meaningful from the start**.

## Installation

Install `self-assert` with `npm`:

```shell
npm install self-assert
```

## Quick Start

A common workflow is:

1. Define a single main factory method that validates parameters before
   creating a new instance of the object.
2. Use `Assertion.requiring(...)` to define the rules.
3. Use `Ruleset.ensureAll(...)` to execute those rules inside the factory method.
4. Any additional static creation methods should delegate to the main one.

```ts
class Person {
  static readonly nameNotBlank = Assertion.requiring(
    "name.notBlank",
    "Name must not be blank",
    Requirements.isNotBlank
  );

  static named(name: string, ...) {
    Ruleset.ensureAll(this.nameNotBlank.evaluateFor(name), ...otherRules);
    return new this(name, ...);
  }

  protected constructor(protected name: string, ...) {}
}
```

If any assertion fails, a `RulesBroken` error is thrown.
This ensures your objects are **complete and valid** from the beginning.

or the [documentation][docs] for more details.
