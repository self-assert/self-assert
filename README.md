# self-assert

A TypeScript library for creating valid objects, promoting encapsulation and robust design.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

This project is based on the ideas presented by Hernán Wilkinson ([@hernanwilkinson][hernan-url]) in his [Diseño a la Gorra][disenio-a-la-gorra] webinar. The concepts behind `self-assert` were shown in the [second episode][dalg-t1-ch2] and further refined in the [third episode][dalg-t1-ch3]. The videos are primarily in Spanish; however, the code is self-explanatory.

Hernán covers many different topics of modern OOP and software development in his webinar. Key points include:

- Software systems are models of real-world problems. As such, developing software means **designing** a model. Good software is a good model, and a good model is expected to **teach** how to interact with it.
- Designing software is a continuous **learning process**.
- Objects are representations of an entity in the problem's domain and they should represent such entity from the moment they are created. Therefore they should:
  - be created **complete**.
  - be created **valid**.
