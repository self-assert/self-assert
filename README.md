## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by Hernán Wilkinson’s
“[Diseño a la Gorra][disenio-a-la-gorra]” webinar, which explores
many of the principles of good object-oriented design, such as understanding
software as a model of real‑world problems, continuous refinement of that model,
and objects that encapsulate and protect their own validity.
