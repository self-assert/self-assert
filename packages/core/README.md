## Introduction

`self-assert` is a small TypeScript library that
helps you model domain rules _inside_ your objects
â€” not as external validators, but as collaborators in their own creation.

This library encourages a mindset where rules are expressed in
terms of the domain, and
**objects are created complete, valid, and meaningful from the start**.

## Installation

Install `self-assert` with `npm`:

```shell
npm install self-assert
```

## Quick Start

A common workflow is:

1. Define a single main factory method that validates parameters before
   creating a new instance of the object.
2. Use `Assertion.requiring(...)` to define the rules.
3. Use `Ruleset.ensureAll(...)` to execute those rules inside the factory method.
4. Any additional static creation methods should delegate to the main one.

```ts
class Person {
  static readonly nameNotBlank = Assertion.requiring(
    "name.notBlank",
    "Name must not be blank",
    Requirements.isNotBlank
  );

  static named(name: string, ...) {
    Ruleset.ensureAll(this.nameNotBlank.evaluateFor(name), ...otherRules);
    return new this(name, ...);
  }

  protected constructor(protected name: string, ...) {}
}
```

If any assertion fails, a `RulesBroken` error is thrown.
This ensures your objects are **complete and valid** from the beginning.

Please refer to the [documentation][docs] or
[`examples/`](https://github.com/self-assert/self-assert/tree/main/examples)
for more details and use cases, such as:

- `assistants` to guide **form completion**
- validating **async rules**
- a built-in set of **reusable Requirements** for common checks
